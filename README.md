# SE-chatbot
A simple chatbot for StackExchange chat

---

# Setup

1. Download or copy the content of [bot-template.js](bot-template.js).
2. Replace all instances of "ETHbot" with your bot's StackExchange username.
3. After `var y = "Your message here";`, optionally add code to create a message. The message you're replying to is stored in `a`, and the message to send is stored in `y`.
4. Using your bot's account, enter a bot-friendly room on https://chat.stackexchange.com, such as [Beep Boop Maggot](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/30332/beep-boop-maggot).
5. Paste the code into your browser console. Works best in Firefox or Chrome.
6. Enjoy chatting!
7. If you want to stop or start your bot, use the `stop()` and `start()` functions in the console.
